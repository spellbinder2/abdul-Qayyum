## My Background

Growing up in a family of “fatake” (Hausa for “merchants”), I heard stories of cross-border trade across West Africa, from Ghana to Mali. That heritage inspired me to study trade finance at university and eventually dive into data analytics to uncover deeper insights into emerging-market dynamics.

## What I Do

1. **Excel Data Modeling & Analysis**  
   - Power Query transformations, advanced formulas (XLOOKUP/INDEX–MATCH), pivot-table dashboards  
   - Example: Cleaned 100k+ rows of UN Comtrade data for trade-balance analysis

2. **Power BI Dashboard Development**  
   - Data modeling (Date tables, relationships), DAX measures (YoY growth, share calculations)  
   - Interactive visuals (maps, slicers, tooltips)

3. **Trade & Supply-Chain Domain Expertise**  
   - Familiar with UCP 600, Incoterms, HS codes, export/import documentation  
   - Focus: Emerging markets (Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America)
